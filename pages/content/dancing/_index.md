My space for experiments in signal processing, SDR, and amateur radio.
From airband frequency lists to satellite passes and decoding experiments — more coming soon.
Expect configuration notes, recordings, and maybe even images from space.Cuban dance has been a big part of my life for many years — especially casino and son.
I love the playful communication, the groove, and the connection with the music and partner.
Here I share notes on social dancing, musicality, workshops, and inspiring teachers I’ve learned from.
I also plan to collect good places to dance, festival highlights, and practical tips for SBK socials.
And if I ever start teaching again, you might even find a schedule of my classes here
