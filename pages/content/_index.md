With over 20 years of experience in Unix system engineering, I bring a passion for building resilient, efficient systems as well as for programming in Go. Iâ€™m also exploring Rust as a new challenge, expanding my toolkit in system-level programming.

Outside of it, I hold a HAM license, I am passionate about history, philosophy and enjoy the rhythms of cuban dances like a Salsa or Son :)
