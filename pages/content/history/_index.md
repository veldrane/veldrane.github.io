title: "history"
---

A curated selection of books, documentaries, and radio programs that dig into the stories of our past.
I’m particularly drawn to modern European history — the ideas, conflicts, and people that shaped who we are today.
Expect links to interesting Czech Radio shows, YouTube channels, and historical archives worth exploring.
I also share occasional notes from my own reading and research.
If something sparks curiosity or challenges assumptions, it belongs here.
More content coming soon — once I start organizing my recommendations and notes.
