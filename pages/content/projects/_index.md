title: "projects"

A collection of tools and experiments built mostly in Rust, Go, Helm, and JavaScript.
I focus on identity-aware networking, automation, and low-level infrastructure topics.
Most of these projects come from real-world needs in my lab and production environments.
Expect practical solutions, rough edges, and continuous improvement.
