This configuration generator uses an OpenAPI definition along with Golang templates to create NGINX include configuration files. While primarily designed for generating NGINX configs, it can also be adapted for similar types of configuration outputs. The tool allows developers to automate and standardize the creation of configurations based on API specifications, reducing manual setup time and ensuring consistency across deployments. While functional, the code itself could use some refactoring for clarity and maintainability.
