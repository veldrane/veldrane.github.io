A simple REST API built with the Poem framework, featuring fault injection, artificial delays, OpenTelemetry tracing, Prometheus metrics, JWT/OIDC authorization, and more.  
I use this project primarily to test enterprise infrastructure components, and I keep extending it with new features (Kafka support is coming soon).  
Some modules are still a work in progress â€” thanks for your patience.
